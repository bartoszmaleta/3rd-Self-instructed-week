# Thatâ€™s quite an unwieldy way to do something very simple. 
# Fortunately, we can rewrite simple loops like this to use a cleaner 
# and more readable syntax by using comprehensions.

# A comprehension is a kind of filter which we can define on an iterable 
# based on some condition. The result is another iterable. Here are some 
# examples of list comprehensions:

doubles = [2 * number for number in numbers]
print(doubles)

even_numbers = [number for number in numbers if number % 2 == 0]
print(even_numbers)

vowel_animals = [animal for animal in animals if animal[0] in 'aeiou']
print(vowel_animals)

# The comprehension is the part written between square brackets on each line. 
# Each of these comprehensions results in the creation of a new list object.

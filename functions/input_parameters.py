# For example, we can make the function we defined above more useful if we make the message customisable:


def print_a_message(message):
    print(message)


# More usefully, we can pass in two numbers and add them together:


def print_sum(a, b):
    print(a + b)


# print_sum() # this won't work

print_sum(2, 3)  # this is correct
